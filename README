el: mnemonic wrapper for $EDITOR

COMPILE:
    cc -Wall -lreadline -lncurses -DHAVE_LIBREADLINE el.c
    cc -Wall el.c

USE:
    el [-abdhitv] [regex1 regex2 ... regexn]
        -a show hidden files
        -b show binary files
        -d show directories
        -h print this help message
        -i matching is case insensitive
        -t test - print cmd that would be run
        -v only show files that don't match regexes
        -V some info

DESCRIPTION:
    If only one file matches, opens $EDITOR on that file, else displays a
list and shows a prompt. Enter a list number to open that file. Other input
is considered arguments to $EDITOR.
    If the first nonoption argument end in / and is a valid directory, list
files there instead of $PWD.
    If the first char entered at the prompt is !, the entire line is passed
to the shell as a command. List numbers are replaced by the corresponding
file name before being passed to the shell. An attempt is made to handle
escapes and double quoting correctly. If compiled with readline support, 
tab completion on the prompt list works.

EXAMPLE:
    $ el
    1: Makefile
    2: README
    3: el.c
     : !echo 2 3
    el.c shell.c
    $

ISSUES:
    to fix "ld: unrecognized option '--hash-style=gnu'" put this in front
    of real ld in $PATH:

    # #!/bin/sh
    # LD=/usr/bin/ld
    # ARGS=""
    # for a in $@; do
    #  [ x"${a:0:12}" != x"--hash-style" ] && ARGS="$ARGS $a"
    # fi
    # done
    # exec $LD $ARGS
